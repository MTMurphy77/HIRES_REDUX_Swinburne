Plotting Procedures                       pro/plot             March 2000

The procedures in this directory are useful additions to the intrinsic IDL
plotting capabilities.

CLEANPLOT - Reset all plotting system variables to their default (X) values
CURFULL - Like intrinsic CURSOR procedure but with a full-screen cursor
LEGEND - Create an annotation legend for a plot
LEGENDTEST - Demo program demonstrating the capabilities of LEGEND
LINEID_PLOT - Annotate the identified lines in a spectrum
MULTIPLOT - Create multiple plots with shared axes
OPLOTERROR - Overplot Y vs. X with optional X and Y error bars
PLOTERROR - Plot Y vs. X with optional X and Y error bars
PLOTHIST - Plot the histogram of an array
PLOTSYM - Define useful plotting symbols not in the standard PSYM definition
PARTVELVEC - Plot the velocity vectors of a set of particles
SUNSYMBOL() - Return the character string to plot a subscripted Sun symbol
VSYM - Create "Mongo"-like plotting symbols, rotationally symmetric polygons

PLOTERROR and OPLOTERROR were renamed from PLOTERR and OPLOTERR in June 1998
to avoid conflict with the RSI library procedures.
