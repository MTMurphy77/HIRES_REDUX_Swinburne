Miscellaneous Procedures                      pro/misc         March 2004

The procedures in this directory are general utility procedures that do not
involve astronomy.   They are included here either because they are required
by an astronomy-related procedure, or because they are thought to be of 
sufficient general interest.

The procedure ASTROLIB defines the non-standard system variables !TEXTOUT,
!TEXTUNIT and !DEBUG which some Astronomy Library procedures require to be 
defined before they can compile.

The function TRIM() is kept here for backwards compatibility but is
not used by any other AstroLib procedure, and conflicts with a procedure of the
same name in the IUE Library.

Similarly DATATYPE() is not used in any other AstroLib procedure because it has
diverged from the version of DATATYPE() in the JHU/APL Library

The procedures FIND_ALL_DIR and CONCAT_DIR were originally from the Solar 
Library ( http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/solarsoft/gen/idl/system/ ) but do not
contain the full capabilities of the Solar Library versions.    (This is because
the Solar Library versions call external procedures not in the IDL Astro 
Library.)

GETLOG() - Format the input name as a logical directory in the host OS
GETOPT() -  Parse a user supplied string into numeric value(s).
GETPRO -  Search !PATH directory for a procedure and copy into user's directory
GETTOK() -  Extract a string up to a specified character.
GETWRD() -  Get specified item (word) from a string (in /jhuapl)

HPRINT -  Pretty terminal display of a FITS header (or other string array)
IDL_VALIDNAME() - Emulate intrinsic IDL_VALIDNAME() function for V5.6 and earlier
IEEE_TO_HOST - Convert IDL variable from IEEE bit order to host machine
ISARRAY() - Determine if an IDL variable is an array (in /jhuapl)
IS_IEEE_BIG() - Determine if the host machine is IEEE big endian 
LIST_WITH_PATH() - Search for files within specified directory path
MAKE_2D - Change from 1-D indexing to 2-D indexing
MATCH -   Find the subscripts where the values of two vectors match.
MINMAX() -  Return the min and max of an array in an 2 element vector
MRD_SKIP - Skip a number of bytes from current location in a file or Unix pipe
N_BYTES() - Return the number of bytes in an IDL variable
NINT() - Like intrinsic ROUND() function but returns integer instead of long
NULLTRIM() -Delete all characters after, and including, the the first null
          byte(0).  Called by TAB_PUT.
NUMLINES() - Return the number of lines in a file
ONE_ARROW - Draw an arrow labeled with a single character
ONE_RAY - Draw a ray by specifying starting point, angle, and length
ORDINAL() - Return the English equivalent of ordinal numbers, i.e. '1st','2nd'
OSFCNVRT() - Format the input as a logical name in the host operating system
POLREC - Convert from polar to rectangular coordinates (in /jhuapl)
PRODUCT() - Return the product of all the elements of an array.
QGET_STRING() - Read a string (eg. password) from the keyboard without echoing it
RDFLOAT - Quickly read an ASCII file with columns of data into IDL vectors
READ_KEY() - Like GET_KBRD but returns a code for escape sequences.
READCOL - Read a file of free-format  ASCII data into IDL vectors
READFMT - Quickly read a file of fixed-format ASCII data into IDL vectors
RECPOL - Convert from rectangular to polar coordinates (in /jhuapl)
REMCHAR - Remove all appearances of a character from a string.
REM_DUP() - Remove duplicate values from a vector.
REMOVE -  Contract a vector or up to 8 vectors by removing specified
          elements.
REPCHR() -  Replace all occurrences of one character by another (in /jhuapl)
REPSTR() -  Replace all occurrences of one substring in a string by another.
SCREEN_SELECT - Allow user to interactively select from a list of strings
                Used by the database software

TEXTOPEN - Open a file for text output as specified by !TEXTOUT
           Controls the print output device for many procedures.
